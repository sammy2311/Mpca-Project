# Mpca-Project
A new Payment system for PESU ECC which uses a fingerprint scanner to capture the student's fingerprint and uses it as a method to pay the vendors.Our project uses a 
database which has information about the student's fingerprint and their credit amount which they can use to make purchases throughout the university. The vendor's have
the choice to change the menu and the prices at any time. Our project also uses an OLED dislay to display all the messages to the vendors and students. Flask( A python 
micro-framework ) was used to implement the backend and the rest of the code was implemented in simple python3.
